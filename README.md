# AFL Data Generating

This project was born out of my slight obsession with sporcle.com. I was unable to find many good quizes for my favourite sport, so I decided to start making my own. This project will retrieve data from afltables.com and generate lists of players based on different stats and data ready to be uploaded straight into Sporcle's quiz creation.

## Prerequisites

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Usage

### Install

`npm install`

### Build and generate

`npm run data-gen`

The output data will be in the `./data` directory
